  Way back in June 1995, when I used to write freelance articles for Athens
  Magazine, I wrote an article about Winterville, Georgia and included a sidebar
  called "Marigold Magic" about the popular Marigold Festival. Today, in
  celebration of the upcoming May 21, 2016 Winterville Marigold Festival, I am
  posting this article here.
