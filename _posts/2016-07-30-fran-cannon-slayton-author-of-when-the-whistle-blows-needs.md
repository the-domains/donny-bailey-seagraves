  I met Fran Cannon Slayton, author of the children's middle grade novel, When
  The Whistle Blows , published in 2009 by Philomel Books, at the Southern
  Independent Bookseller's Alliance (SIBA) trade show in Greenville, South
  Carolina in September 2009. My children's middle grade novel, Gone From These
  Woods , had just been published by Random House's Delacorte Press.
